            <h4> PCB HeatMapper - 2020 </h4>
            <p>
              Set of files that maps the heat dispersal on a PCB. "maxheat.ulp" is an extension file for Autodesk's EAGLE schematic design software. When run from a .brd file in EAGLE, the .ulp file will gather data from the board and send it to the python file, which then generates a graphic displaying the heat dispersal on the board. This graphic is saved as a .bmp file, which can then be overlayed on the board with one of EAGLE's built-in ULPs. Source code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/jzane8/HeatMapThubber">here.</a>

            <h4> Trigeminal Smell Detection Glasses - 2019 </h4>
            <p>
              Working with Jas Brooks at the University of Chicago's Human-Computer Integration Lab,
              I've been building a device that uses three gas sensors to triangulate the location of a
              gas source, and then informs the user of its direction relative to themselves using EMS
              on the trigeminal nerve. This project hopes to allow people without a sense of smell to
              simulate what it is like to smell, by making use of the nervous system rather than smell receptors.

            <h4> Online Biometric Response Integration & Display - 2018 </h4>
            <p>
              Made while working for UnitedHealthGroup R&D. Integrates Movesense biometric sensors with Google Cloud and a chart display to give
              live feedback over the internet of a user's ECG, temperature, and heart rate data. Could be used by doctors
              and nurses to monitor the vitals of patients without requiring them to be at a hospital 24/7.
